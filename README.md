# Netflix-clone ðŸŽ¥

## About this project
I made this project as a test case for a company. The goal was to develop a Netflix-like app using the TMDB API. 
While TMDB API is generally well documented, the auth control documentation was quite challenging ðŸ˜… These ressources helped me a lot : v4 list(<http://dev.travisbell.com/play/v4_list.html>), V4 Authentication (<http://dev.travisbell.com/play/v4_auth.html>).
Since it was my first time using Vue3 and Tailwind, I made some documentation : you can access it here.
